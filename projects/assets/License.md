# Important:

The term "art" refers to all images, map files, and similar things that could be classified as such in these folders and subfolders.

All art found in this folder and subfolders is copyrighted and does not fall under the standard license of this project.

I will eventually update these assets with a proper license. For now these are not to be used by anyone other than me.

If you do wish to use and/or modify these assets, feel free to contact me via the email address found on my GitHub profile.
